**Project Overview**

**This project focused on developing and deploying a WordPress site for the University of the Third Age (U3A), which aims to provide an accessible online platform for elderly users to engage in lifelong learning. The website was developed using a custom child theme tailored to the needs of older adults, focusing on simplicity, readability, and ease of navigation.**

**The project utilized industry-standard tools such as Git, Docker, and GitHub Actions, ensuring a robust and efficient workflow from local development to production deployment. Special emphasis was placed on accessibility and user experience to meet the specific needs of the U3A audience.**

**Technologies and Tools Used**

- **WordPress: The core content management system used to develop the website, with a focus on providing a flexible, easy-to-use interface for elderly users.**
- **Child Theme Development: I created a custom child theme based on the U3A theme, ensuring that the design aligned with the needs of older users by focusing on clarity and simplicity.**
  - **Font Size: To improve readability for elderly users, I increased the default font size across the site, ensuring that text is easy to read without the need for zooming in.**
  - **Content Organization: The website’s content was divided into clear categories, making navigation straightforward and intuitive, which is essential for users who may not be as familiar with complex web interfaces.**
- **Git and GitHub: Version control was implemented using Git, ensuring that all changes were tracked effectively. GitHub was used to manage the repository and to automate the deployment process.**
- **Docker: A Docker-based local development environment was set up to replicate the production environment, ensuring consistency between the two.**
- **AWS: The production version of the website was hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), providing a scalable and reliable solution.**
- **GitHub Actions: Automated workflows were set up using GitHub Actions to ensure that changes pushed to the repository were automatically deployed to the production site.**

**Workflow Overview**

**The development process followed a structured approach, beginning with the local setup using Docker, followed by iterative design and development. Each feature was tested in the local environment before being committed to the Git repository. Automated deployment to the AWS production environment was handled using GitHub Actions, ensuring smooth and efficient updates.**

**Design Considerations for U3A**

**As the target audience of this website is primarily elderly users, several key design considerations were made:**

- **Clear Categorization: I organized the website into clearly labeled categories, ensuring that users can easily find the content they need. This design choice was critical in reducing cognitive load and helping users navigate the site with ease.**
- **Increased Font Size: To accommodate the vision needs of older users, I increased the default font size across the website. This ensures that text is large enough to be read comfortably without the need for additional tools like magnifiers or browser zoom features.**
- **Simplified Navigation: The navigation bar and menu items were kept minimal and straightforward, making it easier for elderly users to move between pages without confusion. This simplicity is essential for users who may not be as familiar with complex website structures.**
- **Contrast and Accessibility: I used high-contrast color schemes for text and background to enhance readability and reduce eye strain, which is especially important for users with declining vision.**

**Challenges Encountered**

- **Customizing the Child Theme: Modifying the parent theme to create a child theme that not only stood out visually but also maintained the simplicity required for older users was a challenge. Finding the right balance between aesthetics and usability was key.**
- **Font and Layout Adjustments: Adjusting the font sizes and layout to suit elderly users required careful attention to detail. Ensuring that the text remained readable and that the overall design didn’t overwhelm users was a delicate balance.**
- **Automation with GitHub Actions: Configuring GitHub Actions for automated deployment initially presented some issues, particularly in setting up the workflow to trigger deployments correctly. However, these were resolved through trial and error and research into best practices.**

**Skills Developed**

**During the course of this project, I developed several key skills:**

- **WordPress Customization: I enhanced my ability to create and customize WordPress child themes, focusing on accessibility and user experience for elderly users.**
- **Version Control: I gained proficiency in using Git and GitHub to manage project versions, ensuring that every change was tracked and properly documented.**
- **Automation: I learned to set up automated deployment processes using GitHub Actions, streamlining the process of pushing changes to the production environment.**
- **Problem Solving: I tackled various challenges, such as compatibility between themes and plugins, font scaling for readability, and improving user navigation for older users.**
- **Project Management: I used GitHub Projects to track progress, ensuring that tasks were broken down into manageable steps and completed on time.**

**Summary and Personal Reflection**

**This project provided a valuable opportunity to build a website specifically tailored to an elderly audience, focusing on accessibility and ease of use. Through the process, I deepened my understanding of WordPress customization, version control, and automated deployment.**

**I also gained experience in designing with accessibility in mind, making critical adjustments to ensure that the site was user-friendly for the elderly. These design choices, including larger fonts, clear navigation, and high contrast, were essential to meeting the needs of the U3A audience.**

**In conclusion, this project helped me refine my technical and problem-solving skills while reinforcing the importance of user-centered design. The experience has given me confidence in my ability to create accessible, efficient, and well-designed web solutions for specific audiences.**
