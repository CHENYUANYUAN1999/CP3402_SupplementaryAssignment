This project involved the creation of a WordPress website aimed at serving elderly users, with a specific focus on accessibility and usability. The website was developed for the University of the Third Age (U3A) platform, which encourages lifelong learning among seniors. Using WordPress as the foundation, I developed a custom child theme to ensure that the site met the unique needs of older users.

Key design changes included enlarging the font size for better readability and creating clear content categories to make navigation intuitive. The layout was simplified to help users easily locate information, while a high-contrast color scheme improved text visibility, ensuring the site was user-friendly for seniors.

In terms of the development process, I utilized Git for version control to track all changes and maintain an organized workflow. Docker was employed to create a local development environment that mirrored the production setup, ensuring smooth transitions between local and live environments. The website was deployed on AWS for hosting, providing a scalable and reliable solution. Additionally, I automated the deployment process using GitHub Actions, ensuring that updates were pushed from the local environment to the live site efficiently.

Overall, this project successfully delivered a functional and accessible website for elderly users by incorporating modern development practices and accessibility-focused design adjustments. The site provides a simple, yet engaging platform that caters to the specific requirements of its target audience.
